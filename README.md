# Tresearch
## Trial By Fire

### Project
--------------------------------
Tresearch is an interactive mind mapping tool for documenting users' learning journey.  Users can create their own knowledge tree(s) to document what they are currently learning and have learned throughout their life. Knowledge trees are made up of nodes that consist of a title,  description/summary, and optional tag. Branches that come off of nodes point to nodes that utilize or require knowledge from the previous node. Users can view any other user's public knowledge trees to see what they are learning or have learned and how. If a user finds another userâ€™s tree or a portion of their tree to be particularly useful or helpful, they can rate a particular node or section of the tree and they can also copy that section over to their own tree. Users can add additional information to their public profiles such as what they are currently learning, and where they are working/what they currently do or have done. Users can utilize a search function in order to find people whose trees contain a certain topic or keyword/phrase, and can also utilize a filter to narrow searches by users who are learning said topic, are using said topic (i.e. in their work or otherwise), by rating, and by tags.
